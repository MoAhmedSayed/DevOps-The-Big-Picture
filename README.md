### Globamantics
Globomantics is a fictitious company used to walk through what sometimes the current state look like for a lot of people.
<br />

#### Pain Point: Limited Automation.
- Limited automation is hurting Globlmantics, they've got a lot of manual build it's hard to get infrastructure, and therefore one asking for more than what they need resizing later and this is super painful so in this case manual process is actually causing inefficiency and slow down.
- Globomantics have got Ticket-defined networking instead of software-difen networking for example if you need to update load balancer or add a firwall rule get in line. ticket networking team is overburdend and it runs through tickets in a queue. and this simply slow things down because not enough of this automated.
- Some of QA tests is automated which is great, but code coverage is a bit spotty which result many manual tests, and the result you realy long regression tests when you want to make an update and the backlog of testable code is just sitting in QA's inbox at all times.
- Building new environments for production, testing, performance testing or even developemnt is brutal here. Aspects are automated but each one wants administrators to stitch together different services and configurations this slows teams down and force them to test on environments don't really look like production.

#### Pain Point: Slow Delivery.
- Globomantics is struggling here, delivery spped is not up, ther're seeing competitor ship musch faster than they are, everything here seems to take forever, new apps, bug fixes, software upgrades, going from idea to production, they saying it is agile
but the minimum viable product looks suspiciously like a fully built solution, there's very little incremental learnng happening here.
- The flow is lumpy.
