# DevOps-The-Big-Picture
### Introduction
Nowadays we expect to find software every where heathcare, travel exterperience, customer support, office work, shoping and retail.
Consumer changing threir behavior base on who offers a better digital experience.
75% of U.S. consumers changing their behaviors such as trynig new brands or shoping methods.
55% of businesses think that have less than one year to embrace digital experience before suffering financially and losing market share, so that they have to get a better at software.

### Globamantics
Globomantics is a fictitious company used to walk through what sometimes the current state look like for a lot of people.
<br />

#### Pain Point: Limited Automation.
- Limited automation is hurting Globlmantics, they've got a lot of manual build it's hard to get infrastructure, and therefore one asking for more than what they need resizing later and this is super painful so in this case manual process is actually causing inefficiency and slow down.
- Globomantics have got Ticket-defined networking instead of software-difen networking for example if you need to update load balancer or add a firwall rule get in line. ticket networking team is overburdend and it runs through tickets in a queue. and this simply slow things down because not enough of this automated.
- Some of QA tests is automated which is great, but code coverage is a bit spotty which result many manual tests, and the result you realy long regression tests when you want to make an update and the backlog of testable code is just sitting in QA's inbox at all times.
- Building new environments for production, testing, performance testing or even developemnt is brutal here. Aspects are automated but each one wants administrators to stitch together different services and configurations this slows teams down and force them to test on environments don't really look like production.

#### Pain Point: Slow Delivery.
- Globomantics is struggling here, delivery spped is not up, ther're seeing competitor ship musch faster than they are, everything here seems to take forever, new apps, bug fixes, software upgrades, going from idea to production, they saying it is agile
but the minimum viable product looks suspiciously like a fully built solution.
- The flow is lumpy, there are piles of project proposals sitting in front of project managers, ther are stacks of apps that need testing by QA. there's a truckload of code
waiting for deployment managers to push it out, there's just lot of differnet work sitting in front of different teams. 
- Lack of self-service, the company doesn't have much here. most of every test or production change goes through one team, and development teams aren't really empowered to do much on their own.
- Change Freezes, their holidays where no changes are allowed, the problem is as soon as that changes freezes lifts, they dump hundreds of changes into environments at once, then you can't easily find the offending code when something inevitably fails, so as much as the changes freeze is designed to increase stability, it's actually making things worse.
- Big-bang releases are the norm, causing downtime, some of releases not doing us any favors either
